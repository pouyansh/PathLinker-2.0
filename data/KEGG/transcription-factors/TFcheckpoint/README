TFCheckpoint:
A resource for Human, Mouse and Rat Transcription Factors 
The Transcription Factors in TFcheckpoint are manually checked for experimental evidence supporting their role in 
1) regulation of RNA polymerase II and 2) specific DNA binding activity. 
TFs supported by such evidence are marked as DbTF.

## list of ALL TFs (Uniprot IDs):
cut -f 5 TFcheckpoint.tsv | grep -v gene_symbol | sed 's/,/\n/g' | sort -u > all-tfs.txt

## only get DNA-binding TFs (Uniprot IDs):
awk -F"\t" '($10=="yes"){print $5}' TFcheckpoint.tsv | grep -v gene_symbol | sed 's/,/\n/g' > db-tfs.txt
